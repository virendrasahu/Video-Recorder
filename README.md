#Video Recorder Web Application
  This project is a browser-based video recorder that allows users to record videos and capture snapshots from their webcam. The app includes real-time filters that can be applied to captured images. It's built using the MediaRecorder API and provides a simple, user-friendly interface for webcam media interaction.

Features:-
Video Recording: Start and stop recording from the webcam, with the option to download the recorded video in MP4 format.

Screenshot Capture: Capture still images from the video feed, apply selected filters, and download them as JPEG files.

Custom Filters for Images: Choose from several color filters (orange, brown, pink, and transparent) to apply to snapshots. These filters do not affect the live video stream, only the captured images.

Recording Timer: Displays the recording duration in real-time using a HH:MM:SS format.

Responsive UI: Animated record and capture buttons along with a clean, simple layout for easy interaction.

Tech Stack:-

  Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
  APIs: MediaRecorder API, getUserMedia
